# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# require 'factory_girl'
# Dir[Rails.root.join("test/factories/*.rb")].each {|f| require f}

# setting = Setting.where("shop_id = ?", "shop1.localhost")
# setting.orders = [FactoryGirl.create(:order, :id => 1),
#                   FactoryGirl.create(:order, :id => 2),
#                   FactoryGirl.create(:order, :id => 3),
#                   FactoryGirl.create(:order, :id => 4),
